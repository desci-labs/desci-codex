![DeSci Codex logotype](./codex.png)

This repo contains an implementation for the next generation of the DeSci protocol, built on [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/). The system uses the high-performance [Ceramic-one](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic) node, with legacy ComposeDB support being phased out. It includes data models, P2P networking for content replication, and a test suite to ensure adherence to the spec.

## Packages

The monorepo consists of several packages:
- [**models**](./packages/models/README.md) - Ceramic model definitions and deployment tooling
- [**node**](./packages/node/README.md) - Codex node for P2P data replication and IPFS pinning
- [**lib**](./packages/lib/README.md) - Integration library with typed APIs for Codex interaction
- [**metrics_server**](./packages/metrics_server/README.md) - Backend for collecting and serving node metrics
- [**composedb**](./packages/composedb/README.md) - ComposeDB models and test environment (deprecated)


# Running a node

## State of models
There is still iteration on the design of the models as we are starting with backwards-compatible rollout on the ResearchObject with intact manifests. As we experiment with putting more and more of the manifest content on streams, the model design will stabilise.

**Alpha** means that the model, and hence the ID, will likely change.
**Beta** means that the model is somewhat stable, but there may be an upgrade requiring a migration.
**Stable** means the model is stable, and if any change is necessary we are commited in solving for backward compatibility.

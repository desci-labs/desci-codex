# 🔮 DeSci Codex

DeSci Codex is a protocol for scientific publishing that aims to weave a truly persistent fabric of the scientific record, where publications and all associated material (like data, code, visual material, etc) can be addressed with high granularity in a participatory open-state repository. This without depending on any single actor to maintain it, allowing our collective knowledge to be securely stored and openly accessible.

Head over to the [Quick start](/docs/gitbook/desci-codex/quick-start.md) section to learn what you can do with DeSci Codex.

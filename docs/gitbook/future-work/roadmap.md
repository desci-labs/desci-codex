# 🛣️ Roadmap

## 2025 Q4

* Support for listing directory content of publications directly in the dPID resolver
* Migration of [DeSci Nodes](https://nodes.desci.com), [dPID resolver](https://dpid.org/browse) and associated software from js-ceramic and ComposeDB to [rust-ceramic](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic)
  * This greatly improves stability and resilience of the network, speeds up indexing and queries, and enables network participation with Codex Nodes.
* Public dashboard for Codex network health and data replication metrics

## 2026 Q1

* Public leaderboard for Codex node operators to incentivise community contribution

# 🔁 Relational information

The entities in this section act as links or relations between other entities, adding meaningful edges to the graph for analytics and credit tracking. Note that this selection of entities do not capture the entire metadata capability of the system, only to model the graph relations for a subset of properties.

The entities[research-object.md](../research-object.md "mention") and [research-component.md](../research-component.md "mention") can both hold uncapped collections of arbitrary metadata, and the [attestation.md](../attestation.md "mention") captures community suggestions for said metadata and is technically applicable to any type of entity.
